This dashboard uses all 10 EVM compatible blockchains data for LayerZero protocol that Dune currently supports: Arbitrum, Avalanche-C, BNB, Ethereum, Fantom, GNosis, Optimism, Polygon, Celo and Base.
For the sake of performance, to check detailed ranking of an address, please visit this dashboard: LayerZero Users Ranking For Potential Airdrops? (If using an Arbitrum-like algorithm)
NOTES: For "Bridged Amount", only the native tokens (ETH for Ethereum chain, BNB for BSC chain, etc) sending are calculated. And the "gas" for L0 EndPoint part is estimated. So don't rely on the actual value displayed on this dashboard.
